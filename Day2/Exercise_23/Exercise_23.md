## Target group

* Developers
* People interested in learning about S/4HANA extension and SDK  


## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to retrieve some products data from the S/4HANA Cloud back-end using the S/4HANA Cloud SDK and run it the application on the Neo environment.


## Prerequisites
  
Here below are prerequisites for this exercise.

* A trial account on the SAP Cloud Platform Neo. You can get one by registering here <https://cloudplatform.sap.com>
* Apache Maven
* Java JDK 8
* You finished the first Neo exercise (2_1)
* A S/4HANA system with a working communication arrangment for the Products collection


## Steps

1. [Open your project in Visual Studio Code](#vscode)
1. [Retrieve Product data from S/4HANA](#retrieve-product-data)
1. [Configure a required destination](#destination)
1. [Deploy your application to Neo and run it](#application)


### <a name="vscode"></a>Open your project in Visual Studio Code
In this section you will open your project created in Exercise 2_1 into Visual Studio Code (you should have this already installed in the prerequisites).

1. Open Visual Studio Code

1. From the Welcome page select **Open Folder...**  
	![](images/01.png)

1. Open the project you have created in the exercise 2_1  
	![](images/02.png)

1. The project is loaded into the Visual Studio Code Explorer. In the meantime all the project's artifacts are downloaded in the background as you can see from the status bar.

### <a name="retrieve-product-data"></a> Retrieve Product data from S/4HANA
In this chapter you are going to see how create a new servlet to retrieve Products data from a S/4HANA Cloud system.

1. In the Visual Studio Code Explorer locate the folder *application/src/main/java/com/sap/sample*, right click on it and choose **New File**  
	![](images/04.png)

1. Name the file *ProductServlet.java*: it will be opened in the editor. At the moment it's empty, but we are going to fill it with a new servlet code to retrieve the products from the S/4HANA Cloud back-end  
	![](images/05.png)

1. Enter the following code in the editor for the *ProductServlet.java* file

	```java
	package com.sap.sample;
	
	import com.google.gson.Gson;
	import org.slf4j.Logger;
	import javax.servlet.ServletException;
	import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
	import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
	import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
	import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
	import java.io.IOException;
	import java.util.List;
	
	import com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odata.namespaces.productmaster.Product;
	import com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odata.services.DefaultProductMasterService;
	import com.sap.cloud.sdk.odatav2.connectivity.ODataException;
	import com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.connectivity.ErpConfigContext;
	import com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.connectivity.ErpDestination;
	import com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.serialization.SapClient;
	import com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.logging.CloudLoggerFactory;
	
	@WebServlet("/products")
	public class ProductServlet extends HttpServlet {
	
	    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	    private static final Logger logger = CloudLoggerFactory.getLogger(ProductServlet.class);
	
	    @Override
	    protected void doGet(final HttpServletRequest request, final HttpServletResponse response)
	            throws ServletException, IOException
	    {
	        final SapClient sapClient = new SapClient("100"); // adjust SAP client to your respective S/4HANA system
	        try {
	            final ErpConfigContext erpConfigContext = new ErpConfigContext(ErpDestination.getDefaultName(), sapClient);
	            final List<Product> products = new DefaultProductMasterService()
	            .getAllProduct()
	            .select(Product.PRODUCT, Product.PRODUCT_TYPE,Product.CREATED_BY_USER,Product.PRODUCT_GROUP,Product.BASE_UNIT,Product.WEIGHT_UNIT)
	            .top(5)
	            .execute(erpConfigContext);
	    
	            response.setContentType("application/json");
	            response.getWriter().write(new Gson().toJson(products));
	        } catch(final ODataException e) {
	            logger.error(e.getMessage(), e);
	            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
	            response.getWriter().write(e.getMessage());
	        }
	    }
	}
	```
	Let me give a short explanation to this code:
	- line 1: we declared the name of the package
	- lines 3-19: we import the required classes. Pay attention to the lines 13 and 14: it's there that we are importing the S/4HANA Cloud SDK to use the classes for Products retrieval
	- line 21: we declare the name of the servlet
	- line 33: we are preparing a specific context for the Products using the default destination name, which is "ErpQueryEndpoint"
	- lines 34-38: this is the part where we tell the servlet to retrieve the top first 5 products from the backend, selecting only a few fields from the backend (PRODUCT, PRODUCT\_TYPE, CREATED\_BY\_USER, PRODUCT\_GROUP, BASE\_UNIT, WEIGHT\_UNIT)
	- lines 40-41: we print out the response

	![](images/06.png)

1. Click on **File --> Save** to save the file  
	![](images/07.png)

1. We are ready to build the project to include this new servlet. On the right side, expand the **Maven Projects** section, select the *myneoproject* POM file (it will be opened automatically in the editor), right click on it and choose **Custom Goals...**  
	![](images/08.png)

1. Type in "**clean install**" and hit **Enter**. We are building the project directly from the development environment and not from the Terminal as we have done earlier  
	![](images/09.png)

1. The build process starts  
	![](images/10.png)

1. After a while, you should receive a **BUILD SUCCESS** message  
	![](images/11.png)

1. You can check that the resulting *war* file is available in the *target* folder  
	![](images/12.png)




### <a name="destination"></a> Configure a required destination
In this step you will be guided through configuring the needed destination for your application.

1. Go to your **SAP CP Cockpit** and navigate to your **Neo Trial** environment     
	![](images/13.png)

1. Expand **Connectivity -> Destinations** and click on **New Destination**  
	![](images/14.png)

1. Enter the following values:

	| Parameter | Value |
	| --------- | ----- |
	| Name | ErpQueryEndpoint |
	| Type | HTTP |
	| Description | ErpQueryEndpoint |
	| URL | \<S4HANA\_ENDPOINT\> |
	| Proxy Type | Internet |
	| Authentication | BasicAuthentication |
	| User | \<S4HANA\_USERNAME\> |
	| Password | \<S4HANA\_PASSWORD\> |
	
	Add the following proxy properties to the destination by click the **New Property** button. 

	>Note: these properties are only required on the Neo Trial so that it can reach the S/4HANA Cloud data center.

	| Property | Value |
	| --------- | ----- |
	| proxyHost | proxy-trial.od.sap.biz |
	| proxyPort | 8080 |
	
	At the end save the destination 
	![](images/15.png)
	
1. You can also check that the destination is working by clicking on the **Check Connection** button  
	![](images/16.png)

1. The response should be "302: Redirect". Click on **Close**  
	![](images/17.png)





### <a name="application"></a> Deploy your application to Neo and run it
Let's deploy the application to Neo and run it.

1. In your SAP Cloud Platform cockpit, on the left side, click on **Java Applications**. You should find the old application you already deployed in the exercise 2_1. Stop the application  
	![](images/18.png)

1. Click **OK** to confirm the operation  
	![](images/19.png)

1. Once the application is stopped, delete it  
	![](images/20.png)

1. Click **OK** to confirm the deletion  
	![](images/21.png)

1. Click on **Deploy Application**  
	![](images/22.png)

1. Click on **Browse...**  
	![](images/23.png)

1. Load the **myneoproject-application.war** file you can find in the *target* folder  
	![](images/24.png)

1. Specify the **Java EE 7 Web Profile TomEE 7** and click **Deploy**  
	![](images/25.png)

1. After deployment clicl on **Start**  
	![](images/26.png)

1.Once the application is started, click on the name of the application  
	![](images/27.png)

1. Click on the Application URL  
	![](images/28.png)

1. The application is opened. To go to the HelloWorldServlet you just need to click on the "HelloWorldServlet" link on this page  
	![](images/29.png)

1. The "Hello World" page is shown  
	![](images/30.png)

1. But we want to use another servlet, the one we just created, named "/products". So what we need is just to replace the "/hello" endpoint with "/products" and you should get the list of the first 5 products as we have specified in the code  
	![](images/31.png)

1. Congratulations! You have successfully retrieved a list of Products from a S/4HANA Cloud back-end using the S/4HANA Cloud SDK.



## Summary
This concludes the exercise. You have now learned you can use Cloud Foundry on Neo with the S/4HANA Cloud SDK.
