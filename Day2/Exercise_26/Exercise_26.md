## Description
In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to 

* adapt the application we built in the previous exercise to be ran without the Launchpad
* create a new tile in the S/4HANA Cloud launchpad which launches the application.


## Target group

* Developers
* People interested in learning Application Programming Model 


## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to create a tile in the S/4HANA Cloud Home page to start the application we built in the previous exercise.  

## Prerequisites
  
Here below are prerequisites for this exercise.

* Previous exercises completed


## Steps

1. [Adapt the application we previously built to be ran without the Launchpad](#adapt-application)
1. [Create a new tile in the S/4HANA Cloud launchpad](#create-tile)




### <a name="adapt-application"></a>Adapt the application we previously built to be ran without the Launchpad
What we want to do here is to get rid of the Fiori Launchpad appearing wen we start our Cloud Foundry application we built in the previous exercise, so that it can be run directly.

				data-sap-ui-compatVersion="edge"
				data-sap-ui-preload="async"
				data-sap-ui-resourceroots='{"frontend_XXX": "."}'
				data-sap-ui-frameOptions="trusted">
		</script>
	
		<script>
			sap.ui.getCore().attachInit(function () {
				sap.ui.require([
					"sap/m/Shell",
					"sap/ui/core/ComponentContainer"
				], function (Shell, ComponentContainer) {
					// initialize the UI component
					new Shell({
						app: new ComponentContainer({
							height: "100%",
							name: "frontend_XXX",
							settings: {
								id: "frontend_XXX"
							}
						}),
						appWidthLimited : false
					}).placeAt("content");
				});
			});
		</script>
	
	</head>
	
	<!-- UI Content -->
	<body class="sapUiBody" id="content">

1. Build the project by right clicking on the project name and choosing **Build -> Build**  
	![](images/07.png)

1. After a while you should receive a message informing you that the build process is completed  
	![](images/08.png)

1. Locate the *bpr\_bam\_XXX\_0.0.1.mtar* file in the *mta\_archives* directory, right click on it and do **Deploy -> Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform**

	![](images/31.png)

1. Refresh the browser  
	![](images/32.png)

1. You should find the new tile in the **Extensibility** catalog. Click on this tile

1. The application should open successfully
	![](images/35.png)

1. Congratulations! You have successfully completed this exercise.


## Summary
This concludes the exercise. You should have learned how to adapt the application we built in the previous exercise to be ran without the Launchpad and how to create a new tile for it in the S/4HANA Cloud launchpad.
