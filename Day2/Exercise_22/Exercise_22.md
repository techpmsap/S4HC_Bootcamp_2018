## Steps

1. [Create a Communication User and a Communication System](#communication-system)
1. [Create a Communication Arrangement ](#communication-arragnement)
1. [Test the service](#test-the-service)



### <a name="communication-system"></a> Create a Communication User and Communication System
In the upcoming exercises you will learn how to retrieve and work with data using the S/4HANA Cloud SDK. For this reason we want now to create our own data source so that we can improve our application built in the previous exercise making it able to connect with our S/4HANA Cloud back-end. We start creating our own Communication System. A Communication User will be created as well along with the Communication System.

1. Open the S/4HANA Cloud back-end portal by using the link provided by your instructor

Enter **PROD\_CS\_\<LOC\>\_XX** for both the System ID and the System Name, replacing **\<LOC\>** with the location's acronym where you are attending the workshop (i.e. WDF for Walldorf) and **XX** with your workstation ID. Both information will be provided you by the instructor. When done click **Create**

### <a name="test-the-service"></a> Test the service
In order to test the service provided by your new Communication Arrangement you can put its URL in a REST client like Postman.

	- enter your **Communication User** with its password
	- click the **Send** button
	
	You should get a screen like this where the the Response Status is **200** and a the list of all the available collections is returned. You should be also able to read collection titles like **A_Product**. This means that your service is working fine
