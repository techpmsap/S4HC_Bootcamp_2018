1. By right clicking onto them, you get options to adapt the UI. As these options are partly type dependent you might need to find the right element first to get the option you need.

1. **Hover** over the **General Information** area until it gets the dashed border and open the context menu via **Right Click**.

## Summary
This concludes the exercise. 

In the preceding tutorials, you created a custom business object with a simple data structure and its persistence. Then you generated an UI for this business object and exposed it as an Fiori Launchpad application.

As the generated User Interfaces only list all fields of a business object node, adapting the UI might be necessary to improve usability of it.

You should have learned how to adapt the generated UI of a custom business object. 

Please proceed with next exercise.
