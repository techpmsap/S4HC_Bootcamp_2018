## Description
In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to 

* access SAP Cloud Platform NEO and Cloud Foundry environments
* create a Destination service instance in SAP Cloud Foundry and import the required destination 


## Target group

* Developers
* People interested in learning the SAP Cloud Platform Application Programming Model  


## Goal

The goal of this document is to set up some required services for the next exercises.  

## Prerequisites
  
Here below are prerequisites for this exercise.

* An account on the SAP Cloud Platform: it will be provided by your instructor along with the required credentials
* The destination file you can download [here](files/ErpQueryEndpoint_CF.zip). Extract it in a proper location on your disk


## Steps

1. [Adjust the destination in the Neo environment](#neo-destination)
1. [Create the destination services on SAP CF](#cf-destination)

### <a name="neo-destination"></a>Adjust the destination in the Neo environment
In order to work with Application Programming Model and access the backend from SAP Web IDE we need to do a quick adjustment to the destination on Neo environment

1. Go to your SAP Cloud Platform Trial account <https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit> entering your credentials. Click on the **Neo Trial** environment

	| Name | ErpQueryEndpoint |
	| Type | HTTP |
	| Description | ErpQueryEndpoint |
	| URL | \<S4HANA\_ENDPOINT\> |
	| Proxy Type | Internet |
	| Authentication | BasicAuthentication |
	| User | \<S4HANA\_USERNAME\> |
	| Password | \<S4HANA\_PASSWORD\> |
	
	Add the following properties to the destination by click the **New Property** button. 

	>Note: proxyHost and proxyPort properties are only required on the Neo Trial so that it can reach the S/4HANA Cloud data center.

	| Property | Value |
	| --------- | ----- |
	| proxyHost | proxy-trial.od.sap.biz |
	| proxyPort | 8080 |
	| WebIDESystem | ErpQueryEndpoint |

	| WebIDEUsage | odata_gen |
	
	At the end save the destination

1. Click on the **dev** space  
	![](images/10.png)

1. You are now into your space. It should be empty: if not, please delete any application you find since we require space for our exercise  
	![](images/11.png)

1. Click on the **Service Marketplace** and then on the **destination** tile to create an instance of the **destination** service  
	![](images/12.png)

1. Click on **Instances**  
	![](images/13.png)

1. Click on **New Instance**  
	![](images/14.png)

1. Choose the **lite** plan and click **Next**  
	![](images/15.png)

1. Click **Next**  
	![](images/16.png)

1. Don't select any application for the moment and click **Next** again  
	![](images/17.png)

1. Enter **s4hc_destination** as the instance name and click **Finish**  
	![](images/18.png)

1. Your **s4hc_destination** instance has been successfully created. Click on the name of this instance  
	![](images/19.png)

1. Select the **Destinations** tab on the left hand side and click on **Import Destination**  
	![](images/20.png)
